# Draft.js AST Importer

Allows you to import the abstract syntax tree (AST) output from the companion [`draft-js-ast-exporter`](https://github.com/icelab/draft-js-ast-exporter). Together they form the full cycle of exporting content from a Draft.js editor instance and then re-importing it.

## Why?

Draft.js supports exporting its content JSON, but this format is a little awkward. Blocks of text are disconnected from their style and entity ranges, and the depth of blocks isnâ€™t implicit. So when it comes to rendering that content in contexts outside a Draft.js editor, you need to have an understanding of how those ranges should be applied and how blocks fit together.

The AST generated by `draft-js-ast-exporter` mitigates this issue by joining common ranges together into marked `inline` or `entity` sections, and by allowing blocks to be nested within one another based on their depth.

## Installation

```
npm install --save draft-js-ast-importer
```

## Usage

```js
import {Editor} from 'draft-js'
import importer from 'draft-js-ast-importer'
import yourDecorator from './decorator'

class Foo extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    const contentState = importer(ast)
    this.state {
      editorState: EditorState.createWithContent(contentState, yourDecorator)
    }
  },

  onChange (editorState) {
    this.setState({editorState})
  },

  render () {
    const {editorState} = this.state
    return (
      <Editor editorState={editorState} onChange={this.onChange}/>
    )
  }
}
```
